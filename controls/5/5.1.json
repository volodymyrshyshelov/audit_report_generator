    "description": "Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID make it easier to be secure and help protect the organisation. Security defaults contain preconfigured security settings for common attacks. By default, Microsoft enables security defaults. The goal is to ensure that all organisations have a basic level of security enabled. The security default setting is manipulated in the Entra admin center. The use of security defaults, however, will prohibit custom settings which are being set with more advanced settings from this benchmark.",
    "rationale": "Security defaults provide secure default settings that are managed on behalf of organisations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings. For example, doing the following:\n• Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.\n• Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.\n• Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can’t do MFA.",
    "impact": "The potential impact associated with disabling of Security Defaults is dependent upon the security controls implemented in the environment. It is likely that most organisations disabling Security Defaults plan to implement equivalent controls to replace Security Defaults. It may be necessary to check settings in other Microsoft products, such as Azure, to ensure settings and functionality are as expected when disabling security defaults for MS365.",
